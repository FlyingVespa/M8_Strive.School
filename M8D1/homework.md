5 CRYPTOGRAPHY ALGORITHMS
Today's activity is DYOR (Doing Your Own Research).

Every team should prepare a ~10 mins presentation with slides.

Every team member is going to speak for about 4 mins each.

The presentation should cover:

What is Cryptography
Symmetric Encryption vs Asymmetric Encryption
What is an Hash
And then each team is going to cover one of the following algorithms:

- RSA _<-- assigned_
- AES
- SHA-2
- DSA
- BLOWFISH

Regarding each algorithm, the presentation should go through the main characteristics of it:

include a short story of how this algorithm was born and why
what kind of algorithm is it?
is it a hashing or encryption algorithm - and what's the difference?
cover possible security vulnerabilities
what is/was the algorithm used for with some real-life examples
When you're done with the presentation, log in or register to Kahoot.com, prepare a Kahoot quiz with 5 questions, and share it with your TA which will present it during Debrief
